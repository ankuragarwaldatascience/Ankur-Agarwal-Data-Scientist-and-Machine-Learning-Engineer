<h1> I am a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong analytical background. Expert in Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Science, and predictive models. My work involves developing data-driven solutions. As a machine learning engineer, I build and design self-running artificial intelligence (AI) systems that automate predictive models. <h1>
  
Writing technical tutorials, participating in coding contests, and solving Python and SQL challenges on LeetCode and HackerRank are some of my favorite things to do.
  
These are a few of my favorite tech stacks to learn, explore, and practice Machine Learning such as Python, SQL, Hadoop, Scala, GitHub, and AWS.


I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more! 😊
